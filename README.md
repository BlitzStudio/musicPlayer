# playMusic

To use the library you should provide an array with time stamps and a path to the music folder like this

```javascript
import musicPlayer from "@blitz_studio/music_player";
const player = new musicPlayer();
player.play([""], "PATH");
```

The module will suffer changes so stick to a stable one
